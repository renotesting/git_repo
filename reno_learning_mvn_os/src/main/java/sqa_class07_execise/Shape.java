//Exercise 17:  (Abstract classes)
//•	Write an abstract class Shape. 
//•	Define a String variable “name” and a getter for that variable.
//•	Shape will have 1 overloaded constructor that takes the parameter String name and sets that value to name property.
//•	Shape declares one abstract method double getArea()
//•	Write a circle class.
//•	Circle class should extend Shape class.
//•	Have a property double radius and a getter setter for that.
//•	Have one overloaded constructor that takes 2 arguments, (name and radius).
//•	Name argument should be passed to super class constructor. And radius should be assigned to radius property.
//•	Implement a double getArea() method that does the calculation of 3.14 * r*r and return the value.
//•	Implement the Triangle class similar to circle class, only different there is height and width instead of radius and getArea() will have height and width instead of radius.
//•	Create a shape caller class with a main method in it. Create the object of circle class and triangle class and pass name and radius for circle and name, height and width for triangle while creating object.
//•	Call the getName and getArea method and store the values in the variables.
//•	Print out the variables using sysout.
